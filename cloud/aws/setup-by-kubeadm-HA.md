# Instruction

## 1. Provision EC2 in AWS
  
  - 1.1 Create Key Pair and download for next phase.
  
  - 1.2 Setup security group for Kubernetes cluster.
  
  - 1.3 Setup the launch configration for auto scaling group. 
  
  - 1.4 Launch EC2 with lauch configuration.


## 2. Install Docker 17.03-ce


```
$ sudo su
# apt-get update
# apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
# curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
# add-apt-repository \
   "deb https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
# apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce=$(apt-cache madison docker-ce | grep 17.03 | head -1 | awk '{print $3}')

```



## 3. Install kubeadm/kubectl/kubelet

```
# apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
# curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
# cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
# apt-get update
# apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl

```

## 4. Initialise Kubernetes cluster 

1. setup 3 master-nodes

Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join --token a427b6.3613da5cd180b1a7 10.0.1.95:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f1d4d8e20751c16c7993e3f5cc5c3d4a6928b115819f26877b3a093a3c834006
 
  Or setup etcd cluter nodes
